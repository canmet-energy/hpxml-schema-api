# Contributing to HPXML Schema API

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the HPXML Schema API!

## Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/canmet-energy/hpxml-schema-api.git
   cd hpxml-schema-api
   ```

2. **Install in development mode**:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

3. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/ -v
   ```

## Code Guidelines

- **Follow PEP 8**: Use `black` for formatting and `ruff` for linting
- **Type hints**: Add type hints for new functions and classes
- **Documentation**: Include docstrings for public functions and classes
- **Tests**: Add tests for new functionality

### Docstring Style (Google Style Standard)

All new or modified public modules, classes, functions, and methods MUST include
Google-style docstrings. Core principles:

1. Start with a concise one-line summary (imperative mood) followed by a blank line.
2. Provide context & rationale if non-obvious (design choices, trade-offs, caveats).
3. List sections in this order when applicable: Args, Returns, Raises, Yields,
   Attributes, Examples, Notes.
4. Use type hints in signatures rather than repeating types in Args unless clarification is needed.
5. Provide at least one Example for functions with non-trivial behavior or side effects.

Example (function):

```python
def merge_nodes(primary: RuleNode, secondary: RuleNode) -> RuleNode:
   """Merge two RuleNode subtrees into a combined structure.

   Args:
      primary: Node whose values take precedence when conflicts occur.
      secondary: Node providing fallback values and additional children.

   Returns:
      RuleNode: New merged node (inputs are not mutated).

   Example:
      >>> a = RuleNode(xpath="/A", name="A", kind="section")
      >>> b = RuleNode(xpath="/A", name="A", kind="section", notes=["alt"])
      >>> merged = merge_nodes(a, b)
      >>> merged.notes
      ['alt']
   """
```

Example (class with rich docstring):

```python
class EnhancedValidationEngine:
   """Facade for multi-layer HPXML validation.

   Combines schema, Schematron, custom rule, and cross-field validation while
   emitting performance metrics. Prefer this over calling BusinessRuleValidator
   directly in API layers.

   Example:
      >>> engine = EnhancedValidationEngine()
      >>> res = engine.validate_field('/HPXML/Some/Field', 'value')
      >>> res.valid
      True
   """
```

Avoid:
* Re-stating logic already obvious from the code.
* Embedding large multi-step tutorials in function docstrings (place those in `docs/`).
* Using reStructuredText field lists (``:param x:``) â€“ the project standard is Google style.

### When to Add Examples

Provide Examples if any of these apply:
* The function has optional behaviors controlled by parameters.
* The return value shape is non-trivial (nested dicts, dataclasses, generators).
* Subtle edge cases exist (empty inputs vs populated, None handling, partial failure scenarios).

### Validation of Documentation

Pull requests may be rejected if:
* New public code lacks docstrings
* Existing docstrings are removed or degraded without justification
* Examples are missing where complexity warrants them

### Updating Existing Docstrings

If refactoring changes semantics, always update the docstring in the same commit. If behavior
changes but the docstring would mislead readers, treat it as a correctness bug.

### INTERNAL vs Public

Use a leading underscore for internal helpers (e.g., `_build_index`) and keep docstrings concise.
Only document internal helpers extensively if they encode complex or non-obvious algorithms.

### Linting / Consistency

We may introduce automated docstring linting (pydocstyle or ruff extensions). Writing consistent
Google style docstrings now minimizes future cleanup.

By following these documentation conventions you help ensure the API is approachable and maintainable.


## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test categories
pytest tests/test_xsd_parser.py -v
pytest tests/test_app.py -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=hpxml_schema_api
```

## Code Style

```bash
# Format code
black src/ tests/

# Check linting
ruff check src/ tests/

# Type checking
mypy src/
```

## Submitting Changes

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Create a feature branch** from `main`
3. **Make your changes** with tests and documentation
4. **Run the full test suite** to ensure nothing is broken
5. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description

## Pull Request Guidelines

- **Clear description**: Explain what the PR does and why
- **Tests**: Include tests for new functionality
- **Documentation**: Update README or docstrings as needed
- **Clean commits**: Use clear commit messages
- **Single purpose**: One feature or fix per PR

## Reporting Issues

When reporting bugs or requesting features:

- **Search existing issues** first to avoid duplicates
- **Provide clear description** of the problem or feature request
- **Include code examples** when reporting bugs
- **Specify environment details** (Python version, OS, etc.)

## Questions?

Feel free to open an issue for questions about:
- HPXML schema interpretation
- API design decisions
- Development setup problems
- Feature implementation guidance

We appreciate your contributions to making HPXML more accessible!
